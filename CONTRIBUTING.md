- `git add <modified-files>`
- `git commit -m "<descriptive commit message>"`
- Replace `<modified-files>` with a list of files you modified.

**Submitting your Contribution:**

1. **Push your changes:** Push your committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

- `git push origin <branch-name>`

- Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created in step 5.

2. **Create a Pull Request:** Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and create a pull request.
3. **Fill out the Pull Request Template:** Provide a clear description of your changes, including the issue being addressed or the feature being added. Follow any existing pull request template guidelines.
4. **Review Process:** We will review your pull request and provide feedback. You may need to make further changes based on the feedback before your contribution is merged.

**Contribution Guidelines:**

- **Follow Code Style:** Adhere to the existing code style conventions used in the project.
- **Write Clear and Concise Code:** Strive for clean, well-commented code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- **Test your Changes:** Ensure your changes don't introduce any unintended behavior. Use unit tests to verify functionality whenever possible.
